Integration Services (SSIS) for the DBA
================

Demo scripts for the talk Integration Services (SSIS) for the DBA at PASS Summit 2014.

You are a DBA and your manager has asked you to manage the Enterprise Data Warehouse, which includes a number of ETL packages. While comfortable with the relational database, you are not sure how to handle Integration Services (SSIS). 

In this session, you will learn what SSIS is and which components it consists of. You will also learn how to use the SSIS catalog, which is new in SQL Server 2012, to track the execution of the package, as well as how to troubleshoot packages when they fail or cause problems.
